# 🧨 Intern Portal CTF – Vulnerable Authentication & FTE System

A deliberately vulnerable full-stack web application designed for **Capture The Flag (CTF)** style security exploration.

This project simulates an **Intern Login and FTE (Full-Time Employment) conversion system** where users are expected to discover and exploit logic flaws, authentication weaknesses, and frontend trust vulnerabilities.

> ⚠️ **This application is intentionally insecure.**
>  
> ❌ Do NOT use this architecture in production.
